<h2 align="center">SKIN CANCER DETECTION AND DIAGNOSIS USING ENSEMBLE LEARNING</h2>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Skin cancer is a widespread and potentially fatal disease that can be challenging to diagnose accurately. Early identification and diagnosis of the disease is crucial for increasing the likelihood of a favorable outcome for treatment. In recent years, deep learning techniques have shown promising results in the computer-aided diagnosis of skin cancer.This study aims to develop an effective skin cancer detection and diagnosis system using the ISIC dataset, which is publicly available on Kaggle. An ensemble learning approach has been proposed that combines the strengths of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), residual networks (ResNets), and dense networks (DenseNets) for enhanced accuracy and robustness. The model has been trained to classify skin lesions into two categories: benign and malignant. Experiments and evaluations conducted on the ISIC dataset achieved high accuracy (87.1%), demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed ensemble learning approach. The suggested model holds significant potential for assisting dermatologists in making accurate and timely skin cancer diagnoses, thereby contributing to early intervention and improved patient care</p>
